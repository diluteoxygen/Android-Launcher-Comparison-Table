# [The Definitive Android Launcher Comparison Table](https://www.notion.so/6671f3b62d8043c4aaaae22a241e3f05)

This table is made to help find a launcher that checks all boxes in terms of need. If you're new to Android theming or Android in general, create a filter below with customizability set to Basic to get started! Credits to [Grabstertv](https://www.reddit.com/user/Grabstertv/) for doing most of the heavy lifting.


## Comparison Basis

We are going to mark the launchers on the following properties:
- Price
- Ads/Bloatware
- Update Frequency
- Source Code Availability
- Customisability
- App Drawer Style
- KLWP Support
- Widget Support
- Material You Colors
- Tablet/Landscape Support
- QuickSwitch Support
- Supported Android Version
- Privacy Policy 

**Note:**
*‚ñ™Ô∏è Icon pack support is not a property in this table because every launcher in this list support Icon packs‚Ä¶ except some that are marked with ‚Äúless than basic‚Äù features.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Privacy report for each launcher is provided via Exodus Privacy. I can‚Äôt tell you how accurate or updated it is, so take it with a grain of salt.*
